<h1>Security</h1>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>
Certain concepts recur throughout different fields of security:
Assurance - assurance is the level of guarantee that a security system will behave as expected
Countermeasure - a countermeasure is a way to stop a threat from triggering a risk event
Defense in depth - never rely on one single security measure alone
Exploit - a vulnerability that has been triggered by a threat - a risk of 1.0 (100%)
Risk - a risk is a possible event which could cause a loss
Threat - a threat is a method of triggering a risk event that is dangerous
Vulnerability - a weakness in a target that can potentially be exploited by a security threat

<h2>Security management in organizations</h2>
<p>
In the corporate world, various aspects of security were historically addressed separately - notably by distinct and often noncommunicating departments for IT security, physical security, and fraud prevention. Today there is a greater recognition of the interconnected nature of security requirements,[6] an approach variously known as holistic security, "all hazards" management, and other terms.
Inciting factors in the convergence of security disciplines include the development of digital video surveillance technologies (see Professional video over IP) and the digitization and networking of physical control systems (see SCADA).[7][8] Greater interdisciplinary cooperation is further evidenced by the February 2005 creation of the Alliance for Enterprise Security Risk Management, a joint venture including leading associations in security (ASIS), information security (ISSA, the Information Systems Security Association), and IT audit (ISACA, the Information Systems Audit and Control Association).
In 2007 the International Organisation for Standardization (ISO) released ISO 28000 - Security Management Systems for the supply chain. Although the title supply chain is included, this Standard specifies the requirements for a security management system, including those aspects critical to security assurance for any organisation or enterprise wishing to management the security of the organisation and its activities. ISO 28000 is the foremost risk based security system and is suitable for managing both public and private regulatory security, customs and industry based security schemes and requirements.
