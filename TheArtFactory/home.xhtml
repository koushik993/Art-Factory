<p style="color:crimson;font-size:40px;text-align:center;">Paintings, Brushes And the ART</p>
<p>Art is a diverse range of human activities and the products of those activities; this article focuses primarily on the visual arts, which includes the creation of images or objects in fields including painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography, and other visual media. Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the decorative arts, it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential—in a way that they usually are not in a painting, for example. Music, theatre, film, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature and other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of art or the arts.[1] Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences, but in modern usage the fine arts, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, are distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied arts.Launched in 1999, Artspan is home to 4,000 artist websites which cover a wide range of disciplines and genres. Work can easily be found and viewed on the individual sites with the varied Artspan search functions. Work that is for sale can also be easily accessed with Shop Originals and Shop Prints searches.

<li class="article">Paintings</li>
<p>Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium[1] to a surface (support base). The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used. In art, the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action.

<li class="article">Oil Painting</li>
<p>Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments that are bound with a medium of drying oil. Commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, poppyseed oil, walnut oil, and safflower oil.
The oil may be boiled with a resin, such as pine resin or frankincense to create a varnish; often prized for its body and gloss.

<li class="article">Artists</li>
<p>An artist is a person engaged in one or more of any of a broad spectrum of activities related to creating art, practicing the arts, and/or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors).
